# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a Movie Recommendation System using Item-based Collaborative Filtering with Hadoop MapReduce.

Data comes from the training dataset of Netflix Prize Challenge.

Multiple MapReduce jobs are used to build and normalize Co-occurrence Matrix, multiply Co-occurence matrix with rating matrix, and generate top k movies that are most likely to be watched by a user.
